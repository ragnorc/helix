Running large models and code that scales for big datasets in this repository is enabled by [Modal](https://modal.com) (no affiliation). It allows us to run code in the cloud on thousands of containers and GPUs without having to think for a second about infrastructure.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting started

1. Create an account at [modal.com](https://modal.com).
3. Open a terminal and run (requires Python 3.10+): ```bash pip install helixbio```
4. Run ```bash modal token new```

## üß¨ Run your first model

Let's predict a protein structure using ESMFold. This also works in parallel for multiple sequences.

```bash
modal run helix.esm::predict_structures --fasta-file "myprotein.fasta"
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of any size! Below are some good ways to get started.

-   **GitHub Discussions**: A great way to talk about features you want added or things that are confusing/need clarification.
-   **GitHub Issues**: These are an excellent way to report bugs. Additionally, you can try and solve an existing issue and submit a PR.
